# C Programs

A compilation of various programs I wrote in C while completing Harvards CS50 course.
Here are what some of the programs are for:
<ul>
 <li> The project in the folder <b>edgeDetectionAndImageManipulation</b> analyses PNG images and can run an edge detection algorithm, or other picture filters on it (greyscale etc.)</li>

</ul>
