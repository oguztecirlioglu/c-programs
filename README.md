# C Programs

A compilation of various programs I wrote in C while completing Harvards CS50 course.
Here are what some of the programs are for:
<ul>
 <li> The project in the folder <b>edgeDetectionAndImageManipulation</b> analyses PNG images and can run an edge detection algorithm, or other picture filters on it (greyscale etc.)</li>
<li> The project in the folder <b>spellChecker</b> checks the spelling of a given piece of text, and uses a custom dictionary inputted by the user of all valid words to verify that the spelling of the text is correct.</li>
 <li> The project in the folder <b>changeVolume</b> manipulates audio of .wav files by changing each byte responsible for the volume of audio at each time interval</li>
</ul>
